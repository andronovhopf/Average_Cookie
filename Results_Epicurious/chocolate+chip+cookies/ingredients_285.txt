2 large eggs
2.4 ounces ( 1/4 cup plus one tablespoon) sugar, plus additional for dipping
1 tablespoon honey
8.2 ounces bittersweet chocolate (I use 2 whole bars plus 2 strips of bittersweet Lindt chocolate which comes in a 3.5 ounce bar and is available at most grocery stores)
3 tablespoons butter
2.6 ounces slivered almonds (about 5/8 cup sliver almonds measured before grinding) ground to a fine powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoons non-dutch processed cocoa powder
