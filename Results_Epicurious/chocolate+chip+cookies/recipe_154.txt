Heat butterscotch chips and peanut butter in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until butterscotch is melted and smooth. Add oats, 1 cup coconut, and salt; stir gently to combine.
Spoon mixture by the tablespoonful onto a parchment-lined sheet tray. Gently press balls in the center to flatten. Chill until set, about 10 minutes.
Heat chocolate, if using, in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium pot of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or in short bursts in the microwave, stirring in between bursts, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Drizzle cooled cookies with chocolate, top with remaining 1/4 cup coconut, and chill until set, about 5 minutes, before serving.
Cookies can be made 5 days ahead. Store in an airtight container and chill.
