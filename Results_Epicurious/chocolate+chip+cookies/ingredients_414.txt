Unsalted butter, for the baking dish
4 ripe peaches, washed and patted dry
5 tablespoons crushed amaretti cookies (about 2 ounces)
1 large egg yolk
1/2 teaspoon cocoa powder
1/4 cup dry white wine, such as Pinot Grigio
Whipped cream, for serving (optional)
To hurry along not-very-ripe peaches, put them in a paper bag, close the top, and let them sit at room temperature until they ripen. I wish I could give you a specific length of time, but you just need to keep checking until they're ready.
