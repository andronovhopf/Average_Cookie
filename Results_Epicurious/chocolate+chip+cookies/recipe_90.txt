Cut the cake into 1/2-inch slices.
In a bowl, combine the peaches with the jam and liqueur and stir until the jam is liquidy.
In another bowl, beat the ricotta, mascarpone, and sugar until smooth and creamy. Fold in whipped cream to taste.
Line the bottom of a 2-quart (2-liter) glass bowl with cake pieces. Top with some of the peaches and their liquid. Spread with a layer of the whipped cream mixture and sprinkle with chocolate. Repeat the layers, ending with the whipped cream mixture on top and reserving some of the cake for garnish. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours or overnight.
Garnish with more chocolate and diced pieces of cake just before serving.
