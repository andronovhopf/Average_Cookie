Nonstick vegetable oil spray
1 cup all purpose flour
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
Pinch of salt
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
1/2 cup (packed) golden brown sugar
2 tablespoons golden syrup (such as Lyle's) or light corn syrup
2 large egg yolks
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
2 2/3 cups premium ice cream (such as dulce de leche or banana), softened
9 ounces bittersweet chocolate (do not exceed 61% cacao), chopped
3 tablespoons vegetable oil
Assorted decorations (such as chopped nuts, colored sprinkles, toffee bits, and cacao nibs)
Even easier: Make sandwiches with your favorite cookies and ice cream. Dip in the melted chocolate, then decorate.
Test-kitchen tip: If you use a soft ice cream (such as dulce de leche), the sandwiches can be served directly from the freezer. If made with a firmer ice cream, they'll need to soften at room temperature for about ten minutes.
