Heat tahini, chocolate, honey, salt, cinnamon, and orange zest in a medium heatproof bowl set over a medium saucepan of barely simmering water (bottom of bowl should not touch water), stirring occasionally, or microwave in short bursts, stirring in between bursts, until melted and smooth.
Carefully pour tahini mixture into a glass or metal tall-sided baking pan (an 8x8" pan works well). Chill until truffle base is firm, 60â€“70 minutes.
Meanwhile, finely chop pistachios by hand or with a food processor. Mix pistachios and sesame seeds in a medium bowl.
Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Scoop tahini mixture by the tablespoonful and quickly roll into 1" balls between the palms of your hands. Toss in pistachio-sesame mixture until coated. Using a spoon, gently transfer to prepared sheet.
Truffles can be made 5 days ahead; cover and chill. Let sit at room temperature 15 minutes before serving.
