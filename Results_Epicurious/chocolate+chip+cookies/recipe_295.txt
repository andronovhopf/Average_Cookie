Melt 7 oz dark chocolate and butter in a double boiler or in a metal bowl set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Let cool. Mix flour, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside.
Beat eggs, sugar, and vanilla until light and fluffy, about 8-10 minutes.
Stir in reserved dark chocolate mixture and remaining 5 oz dark chocolate. Add flour mixture and stir until smooth.
Let mixture rest 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350Â°. Place rounded tablespoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, leaving space between cookies. Bake for 8-10 minutes. Let cool.
Dip cookies in milk chocolate and then in crushed candy cane (or sprinkle candy cane on top). Place cookies on a wire rack to harden.
