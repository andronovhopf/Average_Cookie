In the bowl of a standing mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whip the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar for 3 minutes. Add the egg and yolk and whip for another 6 minutes or until light in color and fluffy.
Sift together the flours, salt, baking soda and baking powder. Switch to the paddle attachment on the mixer and add the dry ingredients and chocolate chips. Mix on low speed until all ingredients are incorporated and mixture looks homogeneous. Dough will be slightly wet.
Chill the dough until set enough to scoop with an ice cream scoop. Or transfer the dough to a sheet of parchment paper and roll into a log. Wrap it in the paper and twist the ends tightly to secure, and chill until firm enough to cut into 1-inch slices, at least 1 hour.
When ready to bake, heat oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, scoop the dough or slice, and space cookies at least 2 inches apart on the baking sheet. Cook for 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown on the edges but still soft in the middle.
