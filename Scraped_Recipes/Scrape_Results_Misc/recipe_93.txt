Cream butter then add sugars and mix until light and fluffy. Add eggs and vanilla. Mix until well-combined. Add flour, oats, salt, and baking soda to butter mixture.

Bake for about 10 - 12 minutes or until lightly browned.
Optional: sprinkle a pinch of salt onto cookies right out of the oven while still warm.
