Preheat oven to 350. Mist a large baking sheet with cooking spray, then wipe it off with a paper towel. (You barely need anything on the pan, the cookies will produce their own anti-stick grease!)
In a large bowl mix together sugars, butter, eggs, and vanilla. In another bowl combine flour, salt, and baking soda and whisk to combine. Add dry ingredients to wet ingredients and mix until just combined (I do this part with a spoon or spatula, instead of a hand mixer etc, to keep the batter from becoming "over mixed")
Roll the dough into 1.5 inch balls (if the dough is way too sticky you can add a little more flour 1 tablespoon at a time until you can roll it - it will still stick to your hands a little bit but that's okay). Place rolled dough balls on prepared baking sheet 2-3 inches apart and press each ball down slightly with the palm of your hand to flatten it a little bit. Stuff extra chocolate chips in the top of the cookies if you'd like. (I always do this) Bake 10-12 minutes.
Remove from oven and allow to cool 5-10 minutes on the pan. Repeat process with remaining dough. Store in airtight container at room temperature.
