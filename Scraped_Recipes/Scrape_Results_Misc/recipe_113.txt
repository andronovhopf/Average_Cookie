reheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugars until they are smooth/creamy. Next, add eggs and vanilla.  Blend well, until smooth/creamy. Now add flour, then salt and baking soda on top – mix until all the dry ingredients are just blended-Do Not Over Mix! Last, add chocolate chips.  Fold the chocolate chips into the dough, until just blended. Do not over mix the chocolate chips with the dough. Place heaping round tablespoons of dough on a ungreased cookie sheet, approximately one inch apart.  I use The Pampered Chef’s Medium size scooper for the dough, it’s the perfect size and I never have to touch the dough ~ love that! Place cookies in the oven on middle rack and bake for 9-11 minutes, depending on your oven. Bake until cookies turn a light golden brown. Remove, place cookies on rack to cool.
