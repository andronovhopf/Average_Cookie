Whisk dry ingredients together in a medium sized bowl.
Then, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Whisk butter and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown. Transfer the butter to a bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.
Beat the butter and sugars until thoroughly blended, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg, yolk, and vanilla until combined. Add the dry ingredients slowly and beat on low-speed just until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.
If you can, chill your dough for 1 hour.
Scoop dough onto baking sheets with an ice cream scoop, and sprinkle sea salt on top. Bake at 350 degrees F, for 7 to 10 minutes. You want the cookies to look under baked in the center, but lightly browned around the outside. Remember, they still cook when you take them out of the oven!
