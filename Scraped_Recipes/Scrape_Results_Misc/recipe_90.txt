Whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl; set aside.
In a large bowl, beat butter and sugars on medium speed of a hand mixer until fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until smooth; beat in vanilla. Add dry ingredients, and beat until just combined; stir in chocolate chips. Roll cookies into about 20 4-ounce balls and place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet about 4-inches apart. Refrigerate for 2 hours.
Heat oven to 350Â°. Bake cookies, rotating pans halfway through, about 15 minutes. Cool before serving.
