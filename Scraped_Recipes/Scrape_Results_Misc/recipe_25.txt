Preheat oven to 375Â°.
In a medium bowl, mix together flour, baking soda, and salt.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, cream the butter and both sugars until light and fluffy. Mix in eggs and vanilla.
Add flour mixture and mix until well combined. Stir in chocolate chips.
Eat a bunch of the cookie dough (kidding!).
Scoop what's left of the cookie dough onto an ungreased baking sheet.
Bake cookies 8 to 12 minutes, depending on how gooey you want those centers to be.
Let cool 5 minutes, then transfer cookies to a wire rack.
