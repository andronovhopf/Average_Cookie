Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or leave ungreased.

In a large bowl or the bowl of you mixer add the sugars and melted butter and mix well until creamy. 

Add the eggs, vanilla, baking soda and salt to the bowl and beat on low speed until well incorporated, for about 30 seconds.

Add the flour to the bowl and mix until crumbles form. Note that you could mix your flour with the salt and baking soda, but I don't find that it makes a difference at all. 

Add the chocolate chips to the bowl and use a spatula to mix them in to the dough. 

You can use a small ice cream scoop to scoop out cookie balls or use your hands to roll out the dough into balls, up to you how big you want your cookies. Place them onto the prepared baking sheet. This recipe yields around 50 cookies, so if you can only bake one tray at a time, place the remaining cookie dough in the fridge until ready for the next batch. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.

Bake 9 to 11 minutes or until just barely golden around the edges of the cookies. DO NOT OVER BAKE. 

Let them cool on the baking sheet for about 15 minutes, then transfer them to  wire rack to finish cooling or enjoy eating them.
