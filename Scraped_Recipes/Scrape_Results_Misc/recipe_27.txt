Position a rack in the lower third of the oven. Heat the oven to 350 degrees F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or use a silicon baking mat.

Whisk the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.

Add the butter, both sugars, and the vanilla to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. (Or, in a mixing bowl, using a handheld mixer). Cream the butter and sugars together on medium speed (speed 4 on our mixer) until light and fluffy; 3 to 5 minutes.

Scrape the side and bottom of the bowl then add the eggs. Mix on medium-low speed for 30 seconds. The eggs will not be completely incorporated.

Turn the speed down to lowest setting and add the dry ingredients in thirds, beating until just combined; 1 to 2 minutes.

With the mixer on low, sprinkle the chocolate chips until just incorporated.

BAKE COOKIES
Drop 3 tablespoon-mounds or use a large cookie scoop onto baking sheets. Leave 2 inches between the cookies to allow for spreading.

Bake the cookies, one sheet at a time and rotating once during cooking, for 15 to 18 minutes. The cookies should be golden brown around the edges but light in the middles. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

Store the cookies in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature or up to a week in the refrigerator.
