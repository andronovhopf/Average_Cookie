Step 1
Heat oven to 375° F.

Step 2
Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or aluminum foil.


Step 3
With an electric mixer on medium-high, beat the butter, sugars, and vanilla for 3 minutes. Add the egg and beat until combined. In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the baking soda. Reduce mixer speed to low and slowly add the flour mixture to the egg mixture until combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.

Step 4
Scoop the dough into tablespoon-size mounds and place on the prepared baking sheets, 2 inches apart. Bake until lightly browned at the edges, 12 to 15 minutes.


Step 5
Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire racks and cool completely.
