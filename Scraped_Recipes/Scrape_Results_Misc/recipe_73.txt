Preheat oven to 375Â°F. Prepare a cookie sheet with parchment paper and set aside.

In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, baking soda and baking powder and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together butter, sugars, salt and molasses on medium speed. Cream for 15 minutes until soft and lighter in color. Add eggs and vanilla and scrape sides of bowl thoroughly. Add flour mixture, creaming until just combined. Stir in chocolate chips.

Spoon dough into 48 small balls and place, 2 inches apart, onto prepared cookie sheet. (If freezing dough, transfer cookie sheet to freezer; once frozen, store dough balls in an airtight container or freezer bag for up to 2 months.) If baking cookies right away, immediately transfer cookie sheet to oven and bake until just barely golden on the edges, 9 to 11 minutes. Serve.
