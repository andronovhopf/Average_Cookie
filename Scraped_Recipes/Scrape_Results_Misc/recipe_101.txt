Start by melting butter and setting butter aside to cool completely.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees and line baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and baking soda.
In the bowl of a stand mixer with paddle attachment, combine melted and cooled butter, both sugars, vanilla and salt. Beat on medium speed until well combined, about 2 minutes.
Add egg and egg yolk, scraping down sides of bowl as necessary.
Add in flour mixture and continue mixing until incorporated.
Add in chocolate chips and give a final stir.
Dough will be soft, but should be firm enough to shape into balls.
Place cookie dough on baking sheet and top with additional milk chocolate chips.
Bake about 9 minutes, just until edges are a light golden brown.
Don't over bake as cookie will continue baking as it cools.
