Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. Line two baking sheets with foil. Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt.
In a mixer fitted with a paddle, cream the butter, sugars and corn syrup for about 3 minutes. Stir in the vanilla, then the milk. Add the flour mixture all at once and blend just until a dough forms. Fold in the chocolate and walnuts. Chill the dough for at least an hour.
Roll 2-tablespoon lumps of dough into balls, then place on the baking sheet and flatten to 1/4 inch-thick disks spaced 2 inches apart. Chill the dough between batches. Bake until the edges are dark golden brown, 14 to 17 minutes. Let cool slightly on the baking sheet, then transfer to a baking rack.
