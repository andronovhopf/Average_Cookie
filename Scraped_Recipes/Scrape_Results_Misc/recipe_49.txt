In a large bowl, whisk together the cake flour, bread flour, baking powder, baking soda, and coarse salt. Set aside. In a large bowl or stand mixer, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, to the butter/sugar mixture and beat well. Add the vanilla and mix thoroughly, scraping down the sides of the bowl as you go. Add the flour mixture gradually, beating until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Fold in the chocolate using a spatula. Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the dough and refrigerate for at least 24 hours, or up to 72 hours. When you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350Â° F. Scoop large spoonfuls of dough onto a parchment-lined baking sheet (I did about 1/4-cup spoonfuls). Sprinkle with the flaky sea salt and bake for 13 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to brown and the middle still looks soft. Remove from the oven and let cool for a few minutes before transferring to a wire rack to finish cooling.
