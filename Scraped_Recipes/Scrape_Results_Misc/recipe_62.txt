Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
In a large mixer, I used my KitchenAid cream together the butter, sugar and brown sugar until light and fluffy.
Mix in the vanilla and eggs.
In a small bowl stir together all of the dry ingredients, whole wheat flour, all-purpose flour baking soda and baking powder.
Gently mix in the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, making sure to mix well.
Stir in 1 Â½ cups of the chocolate chunks.
Scoop out 1/3 of cup of the dough. Break the 1/3 cup chunk in half, place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Press in a few of the remaining chocolate chunks into the dough. Repeat with remaining dough and chocolate chunks. Have 6 cookies per pan, place in oven and bake 8-10 minutes or until edges are a golden brown. Remove from oven and place on a wire rack to cool. Serve.
