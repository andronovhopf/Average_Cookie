Preheat the oven to 350 F or 180 C and line a baking tray with parchment paper.
Cream together the butter and sugars for a few minutes or until ligher and fluffy.
Beat in the vanilla extract and egg, until nice and smooth.
Stir in the baking soda and salt.
Then add the all-purpose flour in batches rather than all at once, just to combine.
Finally, fold in the chocolate chunks and any other add-in until well-distributed through out the batter.
Place 2 tbsp sized mounds of dough onto the prepared sheet, 2 inches apart.
Sprinkle the tops with a pinch of sea salt before placing the tray in the oven for 9-11 minutes or until the chocolate has melted, the dough is slightly golden brown and less glossy than before.
Cool for a couple minutes on a wire rack before serving.
