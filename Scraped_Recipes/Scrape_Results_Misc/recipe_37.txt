Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda and salt, set aside.
For the browned butter: In a small pot over medium heat, melt 1 stick of butter, swirling the pan until lightly browned with a nutty aroma, about 5 minutes. Set aside.
In the bowl of an electric mixer, fitted with a paddle attachment, add one stick room temperature butter, granulated sugar, light brown and dark brown sugars, beat on medium speed until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, and vanilla, beat until combined. Slowly stream in the melted butter, until mixed. Add the flour mixture until completely combined. Stir in the chocolate chips. Using a 1/2 ounce scoop (about 1 tablespoon), scoop the cookie dough onto parchment lined baking sheet, chill in refrigerator for 1 hour.
Preheat oven to 350ÂºF degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.
Place cookie dough 2 inches apart on the lined baking sheets. Bake in oven for 8-10 minutes, until golden around the edges and still soft in the middle. Let cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely, if you desire.
Helpful Tips: 
- Serve with chocolate, vanilla and pistachio ice cream for an easy ice cream sandwich party! Roll ice cream sandwiches in sprinkles, mini chocolate chips and chopped peanuts.
- Let dough chill in freezer for 30 minutes if you are in a hurry to bake!
