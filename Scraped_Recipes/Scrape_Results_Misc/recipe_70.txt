Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (see note about convection). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone liners.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment or in a bowl using a handheld electric mixer, combine the butter, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.
Mix on low speed to combine. Increase the speed to medium and mix for 4-5 minutes until the mixture is light and creamy, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.
Add the egg and mix until evenly combined.
Add the flour and the chocolate chips (or chocolate chunks) and mix until combined and no dry streaks remain.
Scoop the cookie dough into rounded balls (about 2 tablespoons in size; I use my #40 cookie scoop), spacing them an inch or so apart on the prepared baking sheets.
Bake for 9-11 minutes until just very lightly golden (or no color at all) and set around the edges. Let cool for a few minutes on the baking sheet before moving to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining cookie dough.
