In a mixing bowl cream together the butter and sugars until light and pale.
Add the egg and vanilla extract and beat until well incorporated.
Sieve the flour, baking soda and salt into the mixing bowl and mix together with the butter mixture until it forms into a cookie dough. Fold the chocolate chips through.
Roll about tablespoons worth of dough into balls and place on a lined or greased baking sheet.
Bake the cookies in a 190C | 375F oven for 7-10 minutes or until the edges begin to brown.
Leave the cookies to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
