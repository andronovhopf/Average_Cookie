Whisk the flour, salt, and baking soda in a medium bowl. Set aside.
In a separate bowl melt the butter. Add in both white and brown sugars and whisk vigorously for about 1 minute.
Whisk in one egg to the sugar-butter mixture, stirring until it's fully mixed in. Scrape the sides of the bowl with your spatula.
Whisk in the second egg and the vanilla and scrape the sides of bowl again.
Add the dry ingredients to the wet and stir with the spatula to fully combine. Make sure you've scraped the bottom of the bowl and there are no streaks of dry ingredients left. Stir in the chocolate chips. The dough will be soft but DON'T add more flour. It needs to be chilled now to firm up.
IMPORTANT NOTE: Chill the dough for a minimum of 1 hour. This will make it easier to scoop and you cookies will keep their shape better while baking. (This dough can be made and kept in the fridge for 7 days. The dough also freezes really well)
Scoop 14 balls of cookie dough (1/4 cup/100g each) and place on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave some space between the cookies as they spread out during baking.
Bake the cookies at 375oF (190oC) for 12 minutes, or until the edges are set and the cookie is beginning to turn golden brown throughout, but still doughie in the middle. It is really important you don't over bake these cookies otherwise the won't be soft in the middle.
Let cool on the sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
Store them at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. #
The raw dough can be frozen for up to 8 weeks.
