Preheat oven to 160°C (325°F). Place the butter, both the sugars, egg, vanilla, flour, baking soda and cocoa in a food processor and process until a dough forms.
Press the dough out to a 10-inch round on a baking tray lined with non-stick baking paper, scatter with the chocolate and lightly press the pieces into the dough. Bake for 15–20 minutes or until firm to the touch. Allow to cool slightly on the tray. Serve warm with ice cream and caramel sauce.
