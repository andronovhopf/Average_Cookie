In a medium bowl, sift together the flours and the baking soda; set aside.
In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment, cream the butter on medium speed. Add sugars, vanilla, and kosher salt and continue to beat until well combined, light, and fluffy.
With the mixer running, add the eggs one at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl occasionally, and beat until fully incorporated. Add the flour mixture all at once and mix on medium until it just comes together.
Add the chocolate chunks and chocolate pearls and mix on low just to incorporate. Cover mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least an hour (or up to overnight).
About 30 minutes before baking, preheat oven to 350Â°F and line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
Use a medium-size ice cream scoop, scoop dough onto baking sheets, leaving 2 inches of space between cookies. Sprinkle each cookie with a pinch of coarse sea salt and bake for 10 to 12 minutes if you like a soft, gooey center or up to 15 minutes if you prefer crispier edges. Serve warm with a glass of cold milk.
