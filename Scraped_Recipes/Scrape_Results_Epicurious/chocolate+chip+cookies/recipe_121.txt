Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
In a small bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. In a large mixing bowl, beat together the butter, brown and granulated sugars, and vanilla extract until creamy.
Stir the egg into the butter mixture, then gradually beat in the flour mixture. Stir in the white chocolate chunks and half of the wax worms, reserving the rest for garnishing the cookies.
Drop the batter by rounded teaspoonful onto nonstick baking sheets.
Gently press 2 or 3 of the remaining wax worms into the top of each cookie.
Bake until the edges of each cookie are lightly browned, 8 to 12 minutes.
Let cookies cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely.
