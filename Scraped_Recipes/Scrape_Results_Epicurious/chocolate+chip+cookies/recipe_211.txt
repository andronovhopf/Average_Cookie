Place racks in lower and upper thirds of oven; preheat to 350°F. Heat 8 ounces chocolate in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of simmering water (bowl should not touch water), stirring until chocolate is melted; let cool slightly. Reserve saucepan for melting more chocolate for glaze.
Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt in a small bowl; set aside. Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat brown sugar and butter until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add eggs and crème fraîche and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually mix in melted chocolate; reserve chocolate bowl. Mix in dry ingredients just to combine; fold in 8 ounces chopped chocolate. Cover and chill dough until firm, at least 30 minutes.
Drop heaping tablespoonfuls of dough onto parchment-lined baking sheets, spacing 2" apart. Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until edges are set but centers are still slightly soft, 15–18 minutes. Let cookies cool on baking sheets 5 minutes. Transfer to wire racks and let cool.
Melt remaining 4 ounces chocolate in reserved bowl set over reserved saucepan of simmering water. Let chocolate cool slightly, then dip or drizzle cookies with chocolate as desired. Let sit until chocolate is set, 15–20 minutes.
DO AHEAD: Cookies can be made 2 days ahead; store airtight at room temperature.
