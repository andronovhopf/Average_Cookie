Combine the crushed wafers and pecans in a large bowl. Place the chopped chocolate in a separate bowl.
In a small saucepan, combine the cream, corn syrup, and cinnamon, place over medium heat, and bring to just a boil, stirring constantly. Immediately pour the mixture over the chopped chocolate and whisk to blend in the cream as the chocolate melts. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes, then whisk in the bourbon.
Pour the chocolate mixture over the crumb-nut mixture and stir well to combine. Place in the refrigerator to chill for 30 minutes. Form the mixture into balls with a small melon baller (about 2 teaspoons), roll in coatings if desired, and arrange on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Store in an airtight container in a cool place for up to 1 week.
