Preheat the oven to 425°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
Dice the butter into pea-size pieces and chill for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, sea salt, and sugar.
Add the chilled butter to the dry ingredients and loosely incorporate with a wooden spoon. Add the chocolate chips to the mixture, followed by the kefir, mixing gently until loosely incorporated. (The dough should be “shaggy” looking.) Add the raspberries and as you incorporate them into the dough, crush them gently with your spoon. Chill the mixture in the refrigerator for 10 minutes to set.
Scoop out 2 heaping tablespoons of the mixture and use your hands to loosely form a small disk or triangular scone shape. Place on the lined baking sheet. Bake for 12 minutes and let rest for an additional 10 minutes before enjoying.
