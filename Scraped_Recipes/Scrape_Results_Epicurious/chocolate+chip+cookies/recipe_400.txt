Line a 9-inch-round, 1-inch-deep cake pan with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic is tucked into the sides of the pan and leaving at least a 2-inch overhang on all sides. Fill the bottom of the pan with about 1/3 of the coarsely chopped cookies, arranging them so that they lay flat against the cake pan (there will be some small gaps in the "crust").
In a large bowl, combine the remaining chopped cookies with the slightly softened vanilla ice cream, folding to incorporate the cookies into the ice cream. Spoon the ice cream on top of the cookies in the pan, packing it down into the cookie crust. Use a knife to spread the ice cream evenly and smooth the top. Press plastic wrap directly on the surface of the ice cream then wrap the entire cake pan in a double layer of plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight. DO AHEAD: The ice cream cake can be prepared ahead, wrapped in a double layer of plastic wrap, and frozen up for to 2 days.
In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the caramel sauce. In a second small saucepan over low heat, warm the chocolate sauce.
Take the ice cream cake out of the freezer and remove the double layer of plastic wrap, along with the plastic wrap pressed on the surface of the ice cream. Using the overhanging plastic wrap that lines the pan, carefully lift the cake from the pan and place it on a large plate or serving platter. Place a second large plate on top of the cake then invert the cake, remove the first plate, and peel off the plastic wrap. Place the original large plate or platter on top of the cake and invert it a final time so that the cookie crust is on the bottom. Using 2 small spoons, drizzle the chocolate and caramel sauces over the ice cream cake. Serve immediately.
