Combine melted butter and sugars in a large bowl. Stir very well.
Add egg and egg yolk, stir well.
Stir in vanilla extract. Set aside.
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt.
Gradually add flour mixture to wet ingredients — stir well so that all the flour is absorbed.
Stir in chocolate chips.
Place dough in refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350F (177C) and prepare cookie sheets by lining with parchment paper.
Scoop dough by rounded 1 1/2 Tablespoon onto prepared cookie sheets, placing at least 2″ apart.
Bake on 350F (177C) for 11 minutes — cookies may still seem slightly soft in the centers, that is OK, they will cook completely on the cookie sheets. Don’t over-bake or your cookies will be too hard.
If desired, gently press additional chocolate chips into the tops of the warm cookies.
Allow to cool completely on cookie sheets.
